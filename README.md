- The main colors used are pink, purple and a beige colour called "wheat" in CSS.
### * Typography
- The font 'Bebas Neue' is the main font used throughout the whole website with 'Sans Serif' as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 'Bebas Neue' is a font that fits well with the general theme of the website, that is visually attractive and that communicates confidence.
### * Imagery
- For a band website imagery is important. The background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. All the images used on the website have been used to create a uniform theme and to give the user a sense of what type of music the band creates and to communicate an atmosphere that matches the atmosphere that the band’s music might inspire.

## Further Testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

## Known Bugs

* The website has been difficult to modify to the smallest iphone screen size of 4.7in or 11.938cm. The site appears to work as intended, even for this size, when tested using developer tools in Chrome, but on the actual device some elements appear somewhat differently than intended. On all other mobile and tablet screen sizes the site appears to works as intended however. I am at a loss as to how to fix this issue at the moment and will not have time to figure this out before the submission of the project, but will look into it further if time permits after project submission.

## Deployment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages.
